    New Delhi, India – Even as the standoff between Indian and Chinese armies continues in the Himalayan region of Ladakh for eight months now, the local administration’s decision to reopen the Pangong Tso lake for tourism has come as a glimmer of hope for the local residents.

On Sunday, the administration of the newly-created federal territory of Ladakh opened the world’s highest saltwater lake, almost a year after it was closed for tourists due to COVID-19 restrictions followed by the military standoff along the disputed border between the two Asian giants.
    
    Both sides accuse each other of intruding across the loosely-demarcated de facto border, known as the Line of Actual Control (LAC), with Pangong Tso, located 14,000 feet (4,270 metres) above sea level in Ladakh, being one of the flashpoints.
    
    The standoff began in May last year after a scuffle broke out between Indian and Chinese troops at the lake, resulting in 11 soldiers being injured on both sides. A video shot by an Indian soldier and shared on social media showed soldiers from both nations engaged in fistfights and stone-pelting at the LAC.

So where should you go?
Eleuthera in the Bahamas is one option. Along with being a pretty safe Caribbean island to visit, it has a rustic, off-the-grid charm. It’s not a place with a lot of development, and you won’t see massive all-inclusive resorts.

It’s a fascinating place and one where you can make social distancing work as well, so what should you know?

Is Eleuthera Safe?
First and foremost, when you’re traveling to any foreign county, safety is a priority.

Overall, Eleuthera is considered safe. It’s has a slow pace, and aside from perhaps petty crimes involve thefts, most visitors to the area report feeling very safe and confident exploring. You may spend much of your trip not even seeing other people in Eleuthera at all, depending on where you’re staying.""",

    Let’s take a look at three of the most exclusive secret destinations to visit by yacht below.
    You might think Europe can’t have many surprises left, but there are still some exceptionally beautiful secret destinations to be found, one of which is the tiny Greek island of Karpathos, still untouched by mass tourism and boasting a mountainous landscape, picturesque villages, ancient temple ruins and pristine beaches.

Visit three of the island’s loveliest villages – the colourful Olympos, hilltop Othos and Menetes, where the 19th century church offers stunning views. Explore ancient temple ruins at the hilltop Acropolis of Arkassa and near the harbour at Pigadia.

Don’t leave without visiting the two uninhabited mountainous islets, Saria and Sokastro, each studded with Byzantine monuments, and Poseidon’s Cave, a former sanctuary to the god Poseidon and goddess Aphrodite.

Karpathos is also home to some of Greece’s most beautiful beaches, such as Apella, a cove surrounded by lush greenery, the wild and unspoilt Kyra Panagia, and for complete seclusion, Psoraris beach, located on the southernmost side of the island.""",

Truly an image taken from a dream, but not too far from reality! Today we present the top places with the clearest waters in the world! Some of the places are almost inaccessible to ordinary tourists, however, others are easy to access and visit for the lovers of travel and translucent waters. Are you ready for the journey?

The Philippines have the most pristine waters of Asia. Linapacan Island is the smallest island in the area of the region of Palawan but it’s one of the most beautiful islands in the world and the waters of its shores are a true wonder. The island is characterized by a beach of fine white sand and incredibly clear water. It is not considered a tourist area as only 14,000 people live on the island.

Blue Lake is how experts describe the lake with the clearest water in the world. It is located in New Zealand, in the Nelson Lakes National Park. Reaching this place is quite difficult: you have to ask for special permission to the Department of Conservation in New Zealand, including Maori, aboriginal people of New Zealand

Seeing photos of this place makes you believe they have been photoshoped, but most impressive is that it is all natural. The color is achieved thanks to the particular rocks of ice floating in the water during the summer months, leading to this spectacular result.

However, as with any country, there are intricacies to each area, and you need to find the right part for you. Mykonos is a firm favourite amongst many Greek-lovers for a multitude of reasons. Obviously, it’s stunningly beautiful, the locals are welcoming, there are plenty of different regions to choose from, and it’s not very far from home yet has a truly wonderful climate too.

So if you have settled on Mykonos (and with good reason), you may be looking for Mykonos houses for rent and need to select a reputable company through which to do this. You also need to think of a few of the following in order to pick the right villa:
Mykonos is not a huge island, but there are different areas in which you can stay, which will offer different things. If you choose to stay in the town of Mykonos, you will find the most going on. It is busy with shopping, restaurants and nightlife so you can have a lively break if you so desire. If you are after a different type of holiday, then you can opt to stay in one of the beach resorts instead. There are a couple of ‘main’ ones such as Platis Gialos and Ornos, and if you choose to stay in one of these, you will also be in easy access of Mykonos Town as buses run regularly between the two.

How many people will you be heading on holiday with? This, of course, will have a huge bearing on the house you choose to rent. There are villas of all different sizes across Mykonos catering for small families up to large groups so plan who you’ll be travelling with before you start your search.""",
